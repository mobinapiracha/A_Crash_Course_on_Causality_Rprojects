# Causal Inference

This repository is a series of causal inference projects in order to better understand the use of causal inference in analyzing and estimating outcomes. Causal Inference is a powerful technique used in biostatistics, economics and various other discplines in order to estimate pure causality by creating conditions similar to that of a randomized control trials by manipulating observational data. In this analysis we will use a series of causal inference methods including: 

* Matching:https://github.com/mobinapiracha/Causal_Inference/blob/master/Matching_with_R/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown.md
* Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW): https://github.com/mobinapiracha/Causal_Inference/blob/master/IPTW/2020-03-16-causal-inference-with-r-inverse-probability-treatment-weighting.md
